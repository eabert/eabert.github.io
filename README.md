This is my personal website portfolio, which I first created in my down time at Kent Hack Enough 2016, and have updated regularly every semester since then.
Through this project, I practice and demonstrate basic understanding, competency, and upkeep of HTML and CSS code, as well as a general wide technical interest and aptitude as a data analytics student.
