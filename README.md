This is my personal website, which I first created in my down time at my first college hackathon, Kent Hack Enough 2016, and have updated regularly since.
I've had big dreams for what I'll include on this site someday, but for now, I've enjoyed exploring and practicing basic HTML and CSS to make a home for myself on the internet.
