<p><strong>Photography</strong><br />
   I have been taking photos professionally since about 2013, including <br />
   senior photo shoots, modeling portfolio shots, animal and family <br />
   photography, and dance photography. My work can be viewed <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90231275@N06/">here</a>.<br />

   <br /><strong>Service</strong><br />
   My faith plays a huge role in my life. Through my current church, <br /> 
   Jacob's Porch, I am involved in Bible study and worship planning. <br />
   Previously, at my home church, I served as youth representative on <br />
   the Church Board, and have been attending <a href="http://leadershiplab.net/">Leadership Lab</a> since 2013. <br />
   Through my high school youth group, I went on yearly mission trips <br />
   to Kyle, South Dakota, and developed relationships with the Oglala <br />
   Lakota community there, who have been affected by systemic racism. <br />
   Because of this experience, spreading love and acceptance in opposition <br />
   to systemic racism is something that I am passionate about. <br />
   
   <br /><strong>Hiking</strong><br />
   I value balance in life, and see physical activity as a core part of this.<br />
   One of my favorite ways to be active is by spending time in nature and hiking!<br />
   My favorite hikes have been up Harney Peak and Little Devil's Tower.
