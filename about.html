   <h4>Photography</h4>
   <p>I have been taking photos professionally since about 2013, including
   senior photo shoots, modeling portfolio shots, animal and family
   photography, and dance photography. My work can be viewed 
   <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90231275@N06/">here</a>.</p>

   <h4>Service</h4>
   <p>My faith plays a huge role in my life. Through my current church, 
   Jacob's Porch, I play cello in the worship band, serve on the student 
   board, and am involved in Bible study and worship planning. Previously, 
   at my home church, I served as youth representative on the Church Board, 
   and have been attending <a href="http://leadershiplab.net/">Leadership Lab</a> since 2013. Through my high school 
   youth group, I went on yearly mission trips to Kyle, South Dakota, and 
   developed relationships with the Oglala Lakota community there, who have 
   been affected by systemic racism. Because of this experience, spreading 
   love and acceptance in opposition to systemic racism is something that 
   I am passionate about. </p>
   
   <h4>Hiking</h4>
   <p>I value balance in life, and see physical activity as a core part of this.
   One of my favorite ways to be active is by spending time in nature and hiking!
   My favorite hikes have been up <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Black+Elk+Peak/@43.8657747,-103.5331135,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x877d352554e342a7:0x36df8ab920355049!8m2!3d43.8661213!4d-103.5322648">Black Elk Peak</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Little+Devils+Tower/@43.8522901,-103.5406471,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x877d34d46d32e633:0x3a2a7d40fc0c13c0!8m2!3d43.8519304!4d-103.5393596">Little Devil's Tower</a>. </p>
