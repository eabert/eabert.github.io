   <h4>Photography</h4>
   <p>I have been taking photos professionally since about 2013, including
   engagement photos, senior photo shoots, and dance photography. My work can be  
   viewed <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90231275@N06/">here</a>.</p>

   <h4>Service</h4>
   <p>My faith plays a huge role in my life. Currently, I am creating <a href="https://www.firstlutherancincy.org/gathercincy">Gather Cincinnati</a>, 
      an ecumenical young adult ministry to build community and connections between young adults
       of faith in the greater Cincinnati area. In my gap semester after college, I 
worked with people experiencing homelessness through the local PADS
homeless shelter, and served for four months at St. Johannis Lutheran church in Nordstemmen,
Lower Saxony, Germany. </p>  <p>Through my college campus ministry, <a href="https://www.jacobsporch.com/">Jacob's Porch</a>,
I played cello in the worship band, was involved in Bible study and worship planning,
and redesigned the website.  With my home church, I went on annual mission trips to Kyle, South Dakota, and 
developed relationships with the Oglala Lakota community there, who have 
been affected by systemic racism. Because of this experience, advocating against systemic oppression is something that 
I am passionate about. </p>
   
   <h4>Hiking</h4>
   <p>I value balance in life, and see physical activity as a core part of this.
One of my favorite ways to be active is by spending time in nature and hiking.
My favorite hikes have been up <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WMZM2iDMsPCUh3et8">Black Elk Peak</a> (four times!) and backpacking in <a href="https://g.page/hockinghillspark?share">Hocking Hills</a>. </p>
