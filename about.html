<div class="content"><h4>Photography</h4>
   <p>I have been taking photos professionally since about 2013, including
   senior photo shoots, modeling portfolio shots, animal and family
   photography, and dance photography. My work can be viewed 
   <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/90231275@N06/">here</a>.</p>

   <h4>Service</h4>
   <p>My faith plays a huge role in my life. Through my current church, 
   Jacob's Porch, I am involved in Bible study and worship planning.
   Previously, at my home church, I served as youth representative on
   the Church Board, and have been attending <a href="http://leadershiplab.net/">Leadership Lab</a> since 2013.
   Through my high school youth group, I went on yearly mission trips
   to Kyle, South Dakota, and developed relationships with the Oglala
   Lakota community there, who have been affected by systemic racism.
   Because of this experience, spreading love and acceptance in opposition
   to systemic racism is something that I am passionate about. </p>
   
   <h4>Hiking</h4>
   <p>I value balance in life, and see physical activity as a core part of this.
   One of my favorite ways to be active is by spending time in nature and hiking!
   My favorite hikes have been up Harney Peak and Little Devil's Tower. </p>
